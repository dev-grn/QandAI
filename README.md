### Abstract  
Quantum computers are anticipated to have many applications if used properly among enterprises and governments. However, Quantum Errors remain a problem for quantum computing, as the computers are not yet fully immune to “noisy environments” including electromagnetic and particle disturbances. While Quantum Error Correction (QEC) stands to be the most feasible solution to quantum computer errors, the high level of knowledge required to comprehend such algorithms pushes many interested programmers and individuals away from interacting with quantum computers. The paper questions the applicability of traditional computational error correction codes such as Hamming Codes or Reed-Solomon Codes, as a concept and/or fully as in practice, as a novel method to make QEC possible without the use of redundancy qubits. The study compared the performance, accuracy, and efficiency of devised and conventional algorithms by executing integer multiplication and prime factorization. The results show that such hybridization of quantum hardware with Traditional Error Correction has fair merit, especially in execution time with operations with larger data, but may have compromises in accuracy unless highly frequent executions of error corrections are done with constant conversions from traditional to quantum superpositioned data and back, which may eliminate the purpose of quantum hardware. Nevertheless, the paper poses positive prospects for the development of such hybrid technology and suggests methods in which the research could be expanded for further knowledge and specific implementations of programs, apps, or codes to make such error corrections a reality.
